Incompatibilities observed in Debian
------------------------------------

avahi
~~~~~
Looks OK.

hal-device-manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* String lists are presented poorly in the info view due to the changed
  repr() - near line 443
  * patched - smcv
* Everything appears as a 'strlist' because of equality tests on types
  near line 443
  * patched - smcv
* Unregistering object paths is done with callback=None. This won't
  actually unregister, currently (should be fixed in dbus-python)

gajim
~~~~~

* Uses name ``dbus.dbus_bindings.DBusException`` - will fail
  * glue in dbus-python -smcv
* RemoteInterface will need fixing up - uses Variant and tries to
  represent None
* Uses ``dbus_bindings.Signal`` to emit signals!

gnome-osd
~~~~~~~~~

* eventbridge: Uses ``dbus.dbus_bindings.bus_request_name`` to get a name
  * glue in dbus-python -smcv
* server: Old API, but looks OK
* capplet: correctly uses ``SessionBus().start_service_by_name``
* client: nicely simple

jokosher
~~~~~~~~
Looks OK.

listen
~~~~~~
* Uses BusName - need to keep compatible.
* Doesn't provide signatures.
