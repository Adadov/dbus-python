D-Bus Python Bindings 0.80.2 (13 February 2007)
===============================================
- Fix numerous memory and reference leaks
- Only use -Werror if the user specifically asks for it
- Audit tp_dealloc callbacks to make sure they correctly preserve the
  exception state
- Relicense files solely owned by Collabora Ltd. more permissively (LGPL/AFL
  rather than GPL/AFL) - this includes the tutorial and all the C code

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.80.1 (24 January 2007)
==============================================
- The "oops" release
- Install dbus/_version.py, so dbus.__version__ exists again

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.80.0 (24 January 2007)
==============================================
- The "everything changes" release
- Rewrite dbus_bindings (Pyrex) as _dbus_bindings (C) - API changes!
- Define what's public API
- Move low-level but still public API to dbus.lowlevel
- Remove Variant class, add variant_level property on all D-Bus types
- Make signal matching keep working as expected when name ownership changes
- Use unambiguous D-Bus types when transferring from D-Bus to Python
- Follow well-defined rules when transferring from Python to D-Bus
- Add utf8_strings and byte_arrays options in various places, so a user
  can tweak the calling conventions to be more efficient
- Raise RuntimeError if user tries to use a connection with no main loop
  to do something that won't work without one
- Make asynchronous method calls actually asynchronous when made before
  introspection results come back
- Redo main loop machinery so we can add pure-Python main loops later without
  API breakage
- Allow construction of a dbus.service.Object if you don't have a BusName
  (or even a Bus)
- Port introspection XML parser from libxml2 (external package) to expat
  (included with Python)
- Port build system from distutils to autoconf/automake/libtool
- Install a header file for third-party main loop integration
- Make compatible with Python 2.5, including on 64-bit platforms
- Add docstrings throughout
- Add more tests and examples
- Add interoperability tests (which interoperate with Java)
- Add copyright notices!

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.71 (24 July 2006)
==============================================================
- Binary modules are now installed in the correct directory
- Distutils exports the dbus and dbus-glib cflags

D-Bus Python Bindings 0.70 (17 July 2006)
==============================================================
- First release of bindings split
- Move to a distutils build enviornment
- It is possible to now specify sender_keyword="foo", path_keyword="bar" when 
  adding a signal listener
