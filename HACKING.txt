D-Bus Python bindings - notes for hackers
=========================================

Code organisation
=================

Python wants everything except the init function to be declared static, so the
whole of _dbus_bindings is a single translation unit - module.c #includes
various files *-impl.h, which define static (sometimes static inline)
functions. Even so, it compiles quicker than the old Pyrex implementation :-p

Threading/locking model
=======================

All Python functions must be called with the GIL (obviously).

Before calling into any D-Bus function that can block, release the GIL;
as well as the usual "be nice to other threads", D-Bus does its own
locking and we don't want to deadlock with it. Most Connection methods
can block.

Indentation and other holy wars
===============================

Python code is meant to follow PEP8, and has 4-space indentation, no hard tabs.

C code is meant to follow what PEP7 as "Python 3000" style - 4-space
indentation, no hard tabs, otherwise consistent with historical Python 2.x
code.

Docstrings etc. are reStructuredText.
